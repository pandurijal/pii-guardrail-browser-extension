# Privacy Guardrail

Privacy Guardrail is a Manifest V3 Chrome extension that detects personally identifiable information (PII) before text is pasted into supported LLM chat apps. Detection runs **entirely on your device**: deterministic recognizers compiled from Rust to WebAssembly, plus optional transformer NER through ONNX Runtime Web. No pasted text leaves the browser, and the project has no telemetry.

Developed at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/), Data Science and its Applications research department.

> **Status — public beta (`0.2.0`).** Detection is assistive: it helps you catch personal data before it leaves your machine, but it will not catch everything and is not a compliance or DLP product. See [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

## Supported chat apps

- ChatGPT (`chat.openai.com`, `chatgpt.com`)
- Claude (`claude.ai`)
- Gemini (`gemini.google.com`)

Generic or custom sites are not supported in this beta.

## Install

End users should install from the **Chrome Web Store** once the listing is live. Each GitHub Release also attaches the packaged ZIP and SHA-256 checksum for transparency and manual loading.

For an unpacked developer install, see [`docs/developer/building.md`](docs/developer/building.md).

## System requirements

- Chrome desktop stable (latest).
- **Recommended:** ≥ 16 GB RAM and a WebGPU-capable GPU for smooth Local AI detection.
- **Minimum for Local AI:** more than 8 GB browser-reported memory. On 8 GB or less, the extension auto-disables Local AI and runs pattern-only detection. Between 8 GB and 14 GB, Local AI stays on but a slowdown warning may appear.
- On capable systems (more than 14 GB browser-reported memory, passive WebGPU available, and no known CPU/WASM fallback), Local AI may warm automatically while the user is active on a supported chat page.
- Without WebGPU, Local AI falls back to CPU/WASM execution (slower but functional).
- Pattern-only detection runs on any supported Chrome system regardless of memory or WebGPU.

These requirements are high because Local AI runs a transformer NER model entirely in the browser. Lowering them is an active roadmap item.

## How it works

- Intercepts text paste events in supported chat inputs.
- Detects regex/checksum-backed PII such as email addresses, phone numbers, SSNs, credit cards, IBANs, IP addresses, and dates.
- Adds local transformer NER for names, addresses, identifiers, credentials, and other free-text PII when model assets are prepared.
- Shows a review UI before replacing detected spans.
- Replaces selected spans with stable placeholders such as `[EMAIL_1]` or `[PERSON_1]`.
- Stores the placeholder map locally in Chrome storage so model responses can be restored later, with restored values visually highlighted.

No pasted text is sent to a remote inference service. There is no telemetry or analytics. See [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md) for the full privacy posture.

## Known limitations

- Detection can miss sensitive content and can flag harmless text.
- Short names, ambiguous words, code blocks, tables, and unusual formatting reduce detection quality.
- Local AI can be slow or unavailable depending on browser, device memory, and WebGPU support; pattern-only mode covers a narrower set of categories.
- Restoration of placeholders into model responses depends on local records and may not handle every response rewrite.

### For Developers

Quickstart for working on the extension:

```bash
rustup update
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.118
npm install

npm run build:wasm
npm run dev
```

Load `dist/` as an unpacked extension in `chrome://extensions` (Developer mode).

Model-free pull-request checks:

```bash
npm run validate:ci
```

The full transformer build requires preparing BardsAI EU multilingual NER assets — see [`docs/developer/model-assets.md`](docs/developer/model-assets.md). Once prepared, build with strict enforcement:

```bash
NER_MODEL_ASSETS_REQUIRED=1 npm run build
```

### Repository layout

- `src/` — extension TypeScript, UI, offscreen detection, benchmark harness.
- `crate/` — Rust/WASM detection engine.
- `scripts/` — model prep, packaging checks, benchmark helpers.
- `benchmarks/` — benchmark harness; generated corpora and reports stay local.
- `docs/` — user, developer, and design documentation.

Build and local-model artifacts are intentionally not committed: `dist/`, `crate/pkg/`, `crate/target/`, `generated/models/`, `.model-sources/`, `.venv/`, `.private-docs/`, `tests-local/`, and `benchmarks/cache/`. See [`docs/release/public-source-boundary.md`](docs/release/public-source-boundary.md) for the public source boundary.

## Roadmap

Directional themes — none are commitments, and order may change with evidence and community feedback:

- More reliable local PII detection (smaller models, distillation, fine-tuning, hybrid pipelines).
- More browser-efficient inference paths for lower-resource devices.
- Support for additional Chromium-based browsers beyond Chrome desktop stable.
- Mobile support for AI workflows on smartphones.
- Support for additional AI chat platforms.
